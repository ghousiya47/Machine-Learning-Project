### 📌 Weather Analysis (Machine Learning Regression)
A regression-based machine learning project predicting average monthly rainfall using meteorological data.

**Key Results:**
- Evaluated multiple regression models using MSE and R² metrics
- **Best-performing models:** Random Forest and XGBoost Regression
- Decision Tree models showed signs of overfitting
- Ensemble models handled non-linear weather patterns more effectively

### 📌 Most Subscribed YouTube Channels Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)
A data analysis project exploring trends among the most subscribed YouTube channels using visualization and statistical analysis.

**Key Observations:**
- Entertainment and music categories dominate top subscriber rankings
- Subscriber count does not increase linearly with video count
- **High subscriber numbers do not necessarily correlate with higher engagement**

This project focuses on insight generation rather than predictive modeling.

### 📌 Top Foreign Languages Analysis (Machine Learning Regression)
A regression-based project predicting tutor lesson prices for popular foreign languages.

**Key Results:**
- Merged and preprocessed multiple datasets into a unified training set
- Compared regression models using RMSE and R² metrics
- **Best-performing model:** Random Forest Regression
- Pricing was more influenced by tutor engagement metrics than language category alone
